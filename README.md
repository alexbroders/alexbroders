  <summary><h3>Academic Journey</h3></summary>
     As I've mentioned, I am a motivated student studying computer science and physics. My academic journey started at the University of Waterloo taking        Honours Physics. Coming out of high school, I had no experience with computers, let alone programming. In my second semester of first year I was            required to chose one elective, and I chose intro to computer science. The language taught was Dr. Racket. This was my first experience with                programming. Even though I hope to never have to use Dr. Racket again, I really loved the course. Through physics, I have learned many ways of              thinking, most of which are applied to very abstract and not very practical ideas. Coding has given me a way to use my creative thinking skills to          attack, and solve more practical problems which I find very fun and rewarding. My time at UWaterloo was short and I started my second year at              Dalhousie. I transfered into Honours Physics, but I knew I wanted to do more computer science. I took courses in front end development and computer        systems, and at the end my next semeseter I decided to dive in and persue a double major with Computer Science. Now half-way through my third year I        look at Computer Science as my favourite of my two majors. I believe that the combination of the two degrees gives me a unique advantage and makes me      very hireable. It has given me confidence, strong problem solving skills, and a unique set of tools to use when faced with a challenge. Ideally, I          would like to find employement in an area where I can use these skills for the betterment of a driven team.
