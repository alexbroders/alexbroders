  <summary><h3>Academic Journey</h3></summary>
     As I've said, I am a motivated student studying computer science and physics. My academic journey started at the university of waterloo taking honours      physics. Coming out of high school, I had no experience with computers, let alone programming. Then in my second semester of first year I was required      to chose one elective, and I chose intro to computer science where the language taught was Dr. Racket. This was my first experience with programming.      Even though I hope to not have to use Dr. Racket again, I really loved the course. Through physics I have learned many ways of thinking, most of which      are applied to very abstract, not very practical ideas. But coding has given me a way to use my creative thinking skills to attack, and solve more          practical problems which I find very fun and rewarding. My time at waterloo was short and I started my second year at Dalhousie. I transfered into          honours physics again, but I knew I wanted to do more computer science. I took courses in front end development and computer systems, and at the end        of that semeseter I decided to dive in and persue a double major with Computer Science. Now half-way through my second year I look at computer science      as my favourite of my two degrees. I believe that the combination of the two degrees gives me a unique advantage and makes me very hireable. It has        given me confidence, strong problem solving skills, and a unique set of tools to use when faced with a challenge. Ideally, I would like to find            employement in an area where I can use these skills for the betterment of a driven team.
